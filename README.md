# Debug Adapter for Apache Camel

Debug Adapter for [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) based on the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) and [Eclipse LSP4J](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4j) as SDK.

The Debug Adapter allows to set breakpoints and debug Camel textual DSLs.

## Requirements

The Camel instance to debug must follow these requirements:

- 3.15+
- Have `camel-debug` on the classpath
- Have JMX enabled

## Supported scope

- Local only
- Attach only
- Java DSL (not tested with xml and Yaml even if it should work)
- Single context
- Single breakpoint
- Add breakpoint (notably not removing)
- Inspect some variables when breakpoint is hit
- Stop on hit breakpoint
- Resume all
- tested manually only with [Eclipse LSP4E](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4e) so far

## How to use it

- `java -jar camel-dap-server-xxx.jar`
- json parameter to provide on attach:

```json
{
"attach_pid": "xxxxx"
}
```
